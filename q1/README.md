run "python server.py" on one terminal and "python client.py" on one or more other terminals.

on server.py execution, there will be a "COMM>" promt available to us. 
On entering "help", it will produce the list of commands available.

there are 4 options available.those are:
1.) list- prints all online connections
2.) select - select <client_id> selects a client with client_id and allows to send commands
3.) quit - quits current connection with the client you are talking to(to be used when in select mode)
4.) shutdown - shutsdown the server

after using select command, you can start executing unix/linux commands along with "getfile" and "sendfile" commands which are created by me.


Further details can be found in screen shots of q1 in report.
